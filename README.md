Hello friends, 

  I am the founder and developer behind EZ Notes for Android.  I have always been and continue to be interested in technologies that make life EZ for vast numbers of
  people around the world.  In May of 2014, after carful planning and research about how I wanted to try and create such an amazing breakthrough in the space of Organizing, 
  I began working on my App EZ Notes.  Soon other wonderful developers contributed and helped take my promising disruptive  "Ultimate Mobility" concepts to higher and higher
  levels.  I am forever grateful to the many wonderful and talented developers and my fans and supporters for their support and contributions to help fund this ongoing long-term
  promising product which is growing quickly.
  
  I am always learning something new about life and Android and technology in general, so its hard to say what grabs my attention.  But most of all, I am learning the most about
  my own product, its success, and how to continue evolving and improving it over time.  
  
  To help support EZ Notes and contribute to years of ongoing efforts, my team and I appreciate any donations to:  paypal.me/AlexanderMadani
