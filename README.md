Hello friends, 

  I am the founder and developer behind EZ Notes for Android.  I have always been and continue to be interested in technologies that make life EZ for vast numbers of
  people around the world.  In May of 2014, after careful planning and research, I wanted to try and create an amazing breakthrough in the area of Hand-Free Ultimate Mobility!
  That's how I began working on EZ Notes.  Soon other wonderful developers contributed and helped take my promising disruptive  "Ultimate Mobility" concepts to higher and higher
  levels.  I am forever grateful to the many wonderful and talented developers and my fans and supporters for their support and contributions to help fund this ongoing long-term
  promising product which is growing quickly.
  
  I am always trying my best to continue learning new things about life, Android and technology. so its kind of difficult to say what grabs my attention.  
  But mostly I am extremely passionate about EZ Notes, and I am always working hard to try and improve my product for the benefit of others.
